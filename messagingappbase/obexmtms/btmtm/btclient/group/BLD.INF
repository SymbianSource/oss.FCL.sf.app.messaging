// This file basically provides the information required for building the whole of a component
// C & C++ style comments are allowed in this file because it's passed through the C++ preprocessor
// Examples are provided below of the kind of things we're expecting
// 
//

PRJ_EXPORTS
// specify the source file followed by its destination here
// copy will be used to copy the source file to its destination
// If there's no destination then the source file will be copied
// to the same name in \epoc32\include

../Include/btcmtm.h SYMBIAN_APP_LAYER_PLATFORM_EXPORT_PATH(btcmtm.h)
//..\include\btmsgtypeuid.h	<- exported by the generic mtm build process.

PRJ_MMPFILES
// specify the .mmp files required for building the important component releasables
// note that you should specify any .mmp files for test programs further down the file.
//
// It's best if the .MMP files are specified in the order in which the components are
// built, but that eventually shouldn't matter
//
// Use C++ style #defines to denote that a component is only built for a particular platform
//
// specify "tidy" if the component you need to build doesn't need to be released to
// the rest of the company
// specify "ignore" if the MMP file exists but should be ignored - William wants this!


./btcmtm.mmp





PRJ_TESTMMPFILES
// specify the .mmp files required for building any test programs here
//
// you can specify "manual" to denote that a test should be listed in a generated
// batch file for running a group of tests which require user input during testing.
// you can specify "support" to denote that a file is a test support file and shouldn't
// be listed in a batch file for running a group of tests
// By default, each test will be listed in a batch file for running a group of tests
// which can be left to run without requiring watching over by the person running the tests,
// i.e. tests where no user input is required.  The default will apply if neither "manual"
// or "support" is specified.
