Notes on T_IMPS harness 07-Aug-1998
-----------------------

This harness drives the IMPS.DLL component through connecting to an IMAP
server, performing various synchronising and fetching tasks, and then
disconnection. After disconnection, the local folder structure is dumped
to the file:

c:\system\messages\zac.txt

...which can be used to check the server database has been formed correctly.

When run, you get offered a selection of IMAP servers to connect to: if you
have no existing server in your database, pick one of these to create a new
service entry and run against this.

If you have created a service entry in a previous session, and wish to run
against this existing service entry (with its associated data - messages,
folder structure, etc) then key '0', which searches the root of the database
for the first IMAP service, then uses this for the connection. This allows
synchronisation to be tested -

 - Blank database
 - Create new service entry, connect and synchronise trees and inbox
 - Disconnect
 - Using another client, alter the inbox/folder tree
 - Connect again, using option '0'
 - Client synchronises changes on the remote server back to the database

The current operation sequence is this:

 1. Connect to server (checks hierarchy separator if necessary)
 2. Perform full sync operation, which conists of
    - Select inbox
    - Sync inbox
    - Sync folder tree
    - Check remote folder subscriptions
      For each subscribed folder:
      - Select folder
      - Sync folder
 3. Logout
 4. Disconnect
 5. Create text file showing database structure (zac.txt)
