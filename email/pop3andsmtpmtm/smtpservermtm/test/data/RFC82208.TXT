INTRODUCTION

The existing MTM used to perform logging in order to generate a Log-Id necessary for keeping track with status reports. However the CDMA specification
 defines a Message Identifier that gets generated from the stack, therefore logging in CDMA only occurs in the SMS Stack and not in the Server MTM. This 
leads to the restriction of messaging to perform any logging. But this can be an acceptable loss as the only state that the stack will not be able to know is 
the re-schedule, but that information can be regarded as non-essential, since the fact that the message is rescheduled can be found in the TMsvEntry.
