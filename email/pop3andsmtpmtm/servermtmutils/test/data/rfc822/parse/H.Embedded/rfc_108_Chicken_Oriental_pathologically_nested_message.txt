Hi all

My rear towhooks are annoying me (I long ago ditched the front ones) but looking at the bracket
they're on they seem to not be a simple 'add on' as in the fronts but appear to hold the rear
of the car together in some way.

Has anyone removed them permanently or do I just  cut the protruding hook bits off leaving the
bracket to do its (reinforcing?) job?

Or do I just live with them?


p.s. loved the suggestion last week on alternator belt squealing (soap bar trick)..

'apply the bat until squeaking stops'

mistype??? or nocturnal flying mammal cruelty ?? :-)

Is anyone arranging a group drive from the WLR to Duxford?  If not,
would anyone like to join me (maybe we could meet up with the Oxford
group on the way).

I removed the rear tow-hooks (tie-downs whatever) from my Mk1 a few
months ago.  A couple of large bolts and a couple of smaller bolts, I
think I put the smaller bolts back in to hold something in place though
I can't remember what.  Nothing has fallen off yet (nothing that I've
noticed anyway).

Basically, yes you can remove them, once you start un-bolting things, it
all starts to explain itself.

Last night whilst cycling home 3 MX-5s went past me with their lids up.  Now
I know that everybody is well within their rights to drive with their lid up
or down, it's their choice.

However, I have come to the conclusion that if your journey is too short to
warrant putting the lid down then should you really be using the car?
Unless it is totally necessary to use the car (whether it be a MX-5 or not)
then shouldn't people walk, get the bus, use the local taxi firms or cycle?

We are a 1-car family and this has come about purely and simply because it
is just not worth me driving into work.  My journey by cycle takes 12
minutes door-to-door.  If I went by car the total journey can take anything
up to 40 minutes!!  Despite this though, there are still people who live in
my area who insist on driving to work, why?

I know the MX-5 is a wonderful little car but does it really do any car any
good stopping and starting, crawling along at 5 miles an hour (if you're
lucky), not to mention the frustration caused to the driver.

I suppose I am fortunate that I have the option, but how many people do also
and don't take it?

You may remember that I am looking for a second MX-5 or Eunos but this is
simply to get me to Silverstone on a Friday night when I can't get a lift
from a friend.  I will still be cycling to work!!

Now that I have got that off my chest I can get on with some work.  Thank
you for reading my waffle.

A quick question - has anybody out there used the Zymol cleaner and prote=
ctor for soft tops ? =

I remember somebody recommending it and quoting a price of about =A315 I =
think. I tried to order some from Elite but was told I also need to use a=
 conditioner or something to re-seal the hood after using the cleaner/pro=
tector. They only sell it in a kit for about =A350 ! =

Did you use the re-sealer too ? Is it necessary ? Where can I buy the cle=
aner by itself ? Tried Hot n Bovered but only ever get an answering machi=
ne.

Hi,
  Just to add my few pennies worth, I had my 78k service (oil + filter 
change) back in January at 78 plus a changing of brake fluid and coolant, 
which eneded being a shade under 200. I asked how the hell they could 
justify such a price rise for such simple jobs and I beasically explained 
that I would refuse to pay such extortiante charges. The Manager (Tamplins, 
Twickenham) had a bit of a tap on his keyboard and *re-negotiated* the 
labour rates, apparently as a special favour! The final cost came to 145, 
which I thought was a lot more reasonble and the best I was going to get out 
of them. The moral of this little story is that the labour rates are not set 
in stone so try to do a little haggaling!! Anyone else had any similar 
experiences?

Gareth

Hi,
     I've just replaced the stock stereo with a JVC front loading CD unit. Who
was looking for a frequency expander a few weeks ago as I now have one up for
grabs. BTW, the difference in sound quality/clarity is AMAZING when you replace
the stock unit with a unit with built in amplifier !!!

Well on Sunday on the way to the NE OC meet I got
3 penalty points for driving without due care and attention... which
was fair enough....though this is my first driving offence in 12 years...

just had a phone call from my girlfriend 'fran' shes just been done for
speeding...3 penalty points ...she also has been driving for over 10 years
and never had any points...DOH!!!

So if your out and about near york or market rasen etc...be very carefull..
you wont get a warning...there really clamping down... The policemen
told fran that the points stay on your licence for 5 years but for insurance
purposes 3 years... (I was told by my neighbour ...a judge that the reason
it stays on your licence for 5 years..is when the police pull you over and
look at their records...it basically adds weight to their argument should
they wish
to prosecute you.. ie this guy has already got previous driving
convictions...!!!...
it also allows them to say things like...whooo... I see you've been stopped
before!!..
Unfortuntaly this isnt made up!!! ;o(

Ahh well guess me and my girlfriend will at least have a nice drive out to
the police
station.....together!!! ;o)

Cheers

I expect to pay London prices for a garage, but is this a fair price?

If not, can anyone suggest a reliable Mazda garage around the

<sigh> Surely this is a place for MX5 talk, not airing environmental
concerns. Sometimes I have my roof down, mostly when it's sunny. Sometimes I
don't - maybe I'm not going far, maybe I am, maybe I simply _can't be arsed_
to do anything with the roof. I choose when to mess about with the roof - it
is after all, my car, that I paid for. On the whole though, if the weather's
relatively fine, then the roof will be down. I certainly never moan about
other people who have their roof up - Christ, let them do what they want -
each to their own? And I'm a keen cyclist by the way - most evenings when I
get back from work - it's just that I _want_ to drive to work - the last
thing I want to do when I get up in the morning is cycle to work, get buses,
taxis or any other form of inadequate method of British public transport,
primarily because I bought a car so I wouldn't have to suffer any of this.
But, that is my choice after all. As is the operation of the latches that
control my roof release.

    Please let's leave the '5 owners alone who have their roofs up - it's up
to them; it's their car! :-) I don't often join them, but I like to think I
could without recieving abuse from others.....

    The car's great - let's just do whatever we like with them, providing
we're having fun and not affecting anyone else....!

All the best,

Alex.

I have to admit that I drove home last night with the top up - I had a
stinking headache and couldn't face driving with the top down, getting
buffeted by the wind.

I agree with you that many people who only travel a short distance to
work should be walking or cycling rather than using their cars.
However, I tried cycling to work (about 5 miles of country roads - 5
territory) a couple of times and will never do it again.

Apart from the fact that I arrive at the office dripping with sweat and
with nowhere to have a wash let alone the shower that I need, I was
nearly killed a number of times by inconsiderate motorists - especially
the 4wd mother brigade who drive the biggest 4wd they can afford (or at
least, bigger than their neighbours - the Jones's 4wd) to deliver Timmy
to play-school.

Basically, although I enjoy cycling and although it's only about 5 miles
to work, I'm going to continue driving my car for the sake of my health.
After all, it's a much more practical device for these trips than a Jeep
Grand Cherokee with a single baby seat...

At long last, I've put the pictures of my installation up where you can see
them.

Warning, this system is seriously nice. You may find parts of your bank
balance disappearing once you have seen the pictures. Never mind, at least
you'll have a great stereo.

The album doesn't cover the final covering of the drivers, and this is quite
important to the sound of the system. The simple reason is that I haven't
quite finalised this bit and I have a couple of tweaks to do. Rest assured,
more will follow.

Enjoy, I do...

it has a cd input plug on the front if that jogs someones memory.
